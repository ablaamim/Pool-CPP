# CPP modules :

---

The [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) modules is designed to help understand the specifities of the language when compared to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [object-oriented](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_oop.asp) programming.

### What is CPP?

---

CPP is the name of the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) mini pool at 1337, a set of several lists of exercises that go from [object-oriented](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_oop.asp) basics like polymorphism and inheritance to [C++ templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).
<br/>
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) (said C plus plus) is an [object-oriented](object-oriented) computer language created by notable computer scientist [Bjorne Stroustrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) as part of the evolution of the [C family of languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages). It was developed as a [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software) improvement of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system resources.
